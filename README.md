###All copyrights of old files goes to Dboor creators.

Goal of this project is to update these awesome files , add more flexibility to them , make them more secured, clean all the mess and useless code, re-write old things with new, add few custom features, fix known / new bugs.

###There is still no actual testers, if you would like to join please contact me via email : b.expire@gmail.com Or Skype : Jakbut

Please report all the bugs you can find, so they can be fixed faster. 
Live version of script will be available soon.

####Please keep in mind that till stable V1.0 Release commits can be done every week or hour , so don't waste so much time cloning up to date source every time we update it, better wait for stable release if you gonna use it in public. Now these files are completely broken and not worth a cent.
